## 🔍 Critical Differences from Current Implementation

### Needs Updating:
1. **Solution 3 Description** - Add "and daily progress tracking" at end
2. **Solution 4 Description** - Update with complete guided workflow text
3. **All Icon URLs** - Verify against Figma extraction
4. **Card 2 Description** - Confirm correct text is present

### Already Correct:
✅ Overall structure
✅ Hero section text (titles, role, teams, timeframe)
✅ Section spacing (170px padding, etc.)
✅ Colors and typography approach
✅ Grid layout for vision cards
✅ Solution item layout (title/image arrangement)
